\arguments{
\item{data}{an \code{dataframe} or \code{list} object that contains the variables in the model.}

\item{Event.char}{name of the event indicator in \code{data} as a character string. Event indicator should be a
binary variable with 1 indicating that the event has occurred and 0 indicating (right) censoring.}

\item{Z.char}{names of covariates in \code{data} as vector of character strings.}

\item{Time.char}{name of the follow up time in \code{data} as a character string.}

\item{prov.char}{name of stratum indicator in \code{data} as a character string.
If "prov.char" is not specified, all observations are are considered to be from the same stratum.}

\item{group}{a vector describing the grouping of the coefficients. If there are coefficients to be included in the model without being penalized, assign them to group 0 (or "0").}

\item{group.multiplier}{A vector of values representing multiplicative factors by which each covariate's penalty is to be multiplied. Default is a vector of 1's.}

\item{standardize}{logical flag for x variable standardization, prior to fitting the model sequence. The coefficients are always returned on the original scale. Default is \code{standardize=TRUE}.}

\item{lambda}{a user supplied lambda sequence. Typical usage is to have the program compute its own lambda sequence based on \code{nlambda} and \code{lambda.min.ratio}.}

\item{nlambda}{the number of lambda values. Default is 100.}

\item{lambda.min.ratio}{the fraction of the smallest value for lambda with \code{lambda.max} (smallest lambda for which all coefficients are zero) on log scale. Default is 1e-03.}

\item{lambda.early.stop}{whether the program stop before running the entire sequence of lambda. Early stop based on the ratio of deviance for models under two successive lambda. Default is \code{FALSE}.}

\item{nvar.max}{number of maximum selected variables. Default is the number of all covariates.}

\item{group.max}{number of maximum selected groups. Default is the number of all groups.}

\item{stop.loss.ratio}{if \code{lambda.early.stop = TRUE}, the ratio of loss for early stopping. Default is 1e-3.}

\item{tol}{convergence threshold. For each lambda, the program will stop if the maximum change of covariate coefficient is smaller than \code{tol}. Default is 1e-4.}

\item{max.each.iter}{maximum number of iterations for each lambda. Default is 1e4.}

\item{max.total.iter}{maximum number of iterations for entire path. Default is \code{max.each.iter} * \code{nlambda}.}

\item{actSet}{whether to use the active method for variable selection. Default is TRUE.}

\item{actIter}{if \code{actSet = TRUE}, the maximum number of iterations for a new updated active set. Default is \code{max.each.iter} (i.e. we will update the current active set until convergence ).}

\item{actGroupNum}{if \code{actSet = TRUE}, the maximum number of variables that can be selected into the new active set for each time when the active set is updated. Default is number of groups.}

\item{actSetRemove}{if \code{actSet = TRUE}, whether we remove the zero coefficients from the current active set. Default is FALSE.}

\item{returnX}{whether return the standardized design matrix. Default is FALSE.}

\item{trace.lambda}{whether display the progress for fitting the entire path. Default is FALSE.}

\item{...}{extra arguments to be passed to function.}
}
\value{
An object with S3 class \code{strat_cox}.

\item{beta}{the fitted matrix of covariate coefficients.
The number of rows is equal to the number of coefficients,
and the number of columns is equal to nlambda.}

\item{group}{a vector describing the grouping of the coefficients.}

\item{lambda}{the sequence of \code{lambda} values in the path.}

\item{loss}{the likelihood of the fitted model at each value of \code{lambda}.}

\item{linear.predictors}{the linear predictors of the fitted model at each value of \code{lambda}.}

\item{df}{the estimates of effective number of selected variables all the points along the regularization path.}

\item{iter}{the number of iterations until convergence at each value of \code{lambda}.}
