# grplasso

In the contemporary era of big data, the volume of health data generated by healthcare providers, such as hospitals and dialysis facilities, has experienced a remarkable upsurge. As a result, traditional statistical tools for variable selection in high-dimensional data have encountered challenges in maintaining computational efficiency. In response to this issue, the `grplasso` R package has been meticulously developed, offering a powerful solution for efficient variable selection in multi-center data. Demonstrating its superiority, our statistical tool outperforms existing methods by a substantial margin, as validated through both simulated studies and real-world data.
